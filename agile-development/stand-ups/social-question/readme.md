# Social question of the day

The social question of the day is an optional short question to follow the [three project questions](../readme.md) in the daily stand-up. It develops team cohesion and interpersonal trust over the course of an engagement by facilitating the sharing of personal preferences, lifestyle, or other context.

The social question should be chosen before the stand-up. The facilitator should select the question either independently or from the team's asynchronous suggestions. This minimizes delays at the start of the stand-up.

> Tip: having the stand-up facilitator role rotate each sprint lets the facilitator choose the social question independently without burdening any one team member.

## Properties of a good question

A good question has a brief answer with small optional elaboration. A yes or no answer doesn't tell you very much about someone, while knowing that their favorite fruit is a [durian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) is informative.

Good questions are low in consequence but allow controversy. Watching someone strongly exclaim that salmon and lox on cinnamon-raisin is the best bagel order is endearing. As a corollary, a good question is one someone is likely to be passionate about. You know a little more about a team member's personality if their eyes light up when describing their favorite karaoke song.
