# Authors guidance

## Add relevant reviewers

- Add one or more reviewers (depending on your project's guidelines) to the PR. Ideally, you would add at least someone who has expertise and is familiar with the project or the language used
- Adding someone less familiar with the project or the language can aid in verifying the changes are understandable, easy to read, and increases the expertise within the team
- In CSE code-with projects with a customer team, it is important to include reviewers from both organizations for knowledge transfer - [Customize Reviewers Policy](./customize-ado.md#reviewer-policies)

## Be open to receive feedback

Discuss design/code logic and address all comments as follows:

- Resolve a comment, if the requested change has been made.
- Mark the comment as "won't fix", if you are not going to make the requested changes and provide a clear reasoning
  - If the requested change is within the scope of the task, "I'll do it later" is not an acceptable reason!
  - If the requested change is out of scope, create a new work item (task or bug) for it
- If you don't understand a comment, ask questions in the review itself as opposed to a private chat
- If a thread gets bloated without a conclusion, have a meeting with the reviewer (call them or knock on door)

## Track progress

- If the reviewers have not responded in a reasonable time (generally a day or two), ping them or raise the issue in a daily meeting.
