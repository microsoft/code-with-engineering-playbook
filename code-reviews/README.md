# Code Reviews

Developers working on [CSE](../CSE.md) projects should conduct peer code reviews on every pull request (or check-in to a shared branch).

## Goals

Code reviews is a way to have a conversation about the code where participants will:

- Improve code quality by identifying and removing defects before they can be introduced into shared code branches.
- Grow by learning from each other about unfamiliar design patterns or languages among other topics, and even break some bad habits.
- Develop a shared understanding of the project's code.
