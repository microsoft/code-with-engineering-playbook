# Microsoft Engineering Feedback

## Why is it important to submit Microsoft Engineering Feedback

Engineering Feedback captures the "voice of the customer" and is an important mechanism to provide actionable insights and help Microsoft product groups continuously improve the platform and cloud services to enable all customers to be as productive as possible.

> Please note that Engineering Feedback is an asynchronous (i.e. not real-time) method to capture and aggregate friction points across multiple customers and code-with engagements. Therefore, if you need to report a service outage, or an immediately-blocking bug, you should file an official [Azure support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) and, if possible, reference the ticket id in the feedback that you submit later.

Even if the feedback has already been raised directly with a product group or on through online channels like GitHub or Stack Overflow, it is still important to raise it via Microsoft Engineering feedback, so it can be consolidated with other customer projects that have the same feedback to help with prioritization.

## When to submit Engineering Feedback

Capturing and providing high-quality actionable Engineering Feedback is an integral **ongoing** part of all code-with engagements. It is recommended to submit feedback on an ongoing basis instead of batching it up for submission at the end of the engagement.

You should jot down the details of the feedback close to the time when you encounter the specific blockers, challenges, and friction since that is when it is freshest in your mind. The project team can then decide how to prioritize and when to submit the feedback into the official CSE Feedback system (accessible to ISE team members) during each sprint.

## What is good and high-quality Engineering Feedback

Good engineering feedback provides enough information for those who are not part of the code-with engagement to understand the customer pain, the associated product issues, the impact and priority of these issues, and any potential workarounds that exist to minimize that impact.

### High-Quality Engineering Feedback is

* Goal Oriented - states what the customer is trying to accomplish
* Specific - details the scenario, observation, or challenge faced by the customer
* Actionable - includes the necessary clarifying information to enable a decision

### Examples of Good Engineering Feedback

For example, here is an evolution of transforming a fictitious feedback with the above high-quality engineering feedback guidance in mind:

The impact and workaround was choosing containers over Functions. The desired outcome is for Azure Functions to support Service Bus sessions with batch and non-batch processing for all Azure Functions GA languages.** |
