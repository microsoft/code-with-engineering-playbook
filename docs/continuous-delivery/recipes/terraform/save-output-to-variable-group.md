# Save terraform output to a variable group (Azure DevOps)

This recipe applies only to [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) usage with Azure DevOps. It assumes your familiar with terraform commands and Azure Pipelines.

## Context

When [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to automate the provisioning of the infrastructure, an [Azure Pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) is generally dedicated to apply terraform configuration files. It will create, update, delete Azure resources to provision your infrastructure changes.

Once files are applied, some [Output Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs) (for instance resource group name, app service name) can be referenced and outputted by terraform. These values must be generally retrieved afterwards, used as input variables for the deployment of services happening in separate pipelines.

```tf
output "core_resource_group_name" {
  description = "The resource group name"
  value       = module.core.resource_group_name
}

output "core_key_vault_name" {
  description = "The key vault name."
  value       = module.core.key_vault_name
}

output "core_key_vault_url" {
  description = "The key vault url."
  value       = module.core.key_vault_url
}
```

The purpose of this recipe is to answer the following statement: How to make terraform output values available across multiple pipelines ?

## Solution

One suggested solution is to store outputted values in the Library with a [Variable Group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml). Variable groups is a convenient way store values you might want to be passed into a YAML pipeline. In addition, all assets defined in the Library share a common security model. You can control who can define new items in a library, and who can use an existing item.

For this purpose, we are using the following commands:

- [terraform output](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/output) to extract the value of an output variable from the state file (provided by [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli))
- [az pipelines variable-group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/pipelines/variable-group?view=azure-cli-latest) to manage variable groups (provided by [Azure DevOps CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/cli/?view=azure-devops))

You can use the following script once `terraform apply` is completed to create/update the variable group.

### Script (update-variablegroup.sh)

#### Parameters

| Name                | Description                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION | The URI of the Azure DevOps organization.   |
| DEVOPS_PROJECT      | The name or id of the Azure DevOps project. |
| GROUP_NAME          | The name of the variable group targeted.    |

Implementation choices:

- If a variable group already exists, a valid option could be to delete and rebuild the group from scratch. However, as authorization could have been updated at the group level, we prefer to avoid this option. The script remove instead all variables in the targeted group and add them back with latest values. Permissions are not impacted.
- A variable group cannot be empty. It must contains at least one variable. A temporary uuid value is created to mitigate this issue, and removed once variables are updated.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

export DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION=$1
export DEVOPS_PROJECT=$2
export GROUP_NAME=$3

# configure the azure devops cli
az devops configure --defaults organization=${DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION} project=${DEVOPS_PROJECT} --use-git-aliases true

# get the variable group id (if already exists)
group_id=$(az pipelines variable-group list --group-name ${GROUP_NAME} --query '[0].id' -o json)

if [ -z "${group_id}" ]; then
    # create a new variable group
    tf_output=$(terraform output -json | jq -r 'to_entries[] | "\(.key)=\(.value.value)"')
    az pipelines variable-group create --name ${GROUP_NAME} --variables ${tf_output} --authorize true
else
    # get existing variables
    var_list=$(az pipelines variable-group variable list --group-id ${group_id})

    # add temporary uuid variable (a variable group cannot be empty)
    uuid=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid)
    az pipelines variable-group variable create --group-id ${group_id} --name ${uuid}

    # delete existing variables
    for row in $(echo ${var_list} | jq -r 'to_entries[] | "\(.key)"'); do
        az pipelines variable-group variable delete --group-id ${group_id} --name ${row} --yes
    done

    # create variables with latest values (from terraform)
    for row in $(terraform output -json | jq -c 'to_entries[]'); do
        _jq()
        {
            echo ${row} | jq -r ${1}
        }

        az pipelines variable-group variable create --group-id ${group_id} --name $(_jq '.key') --value $(_jq '.value.value') --secret $(_jq '.value.sensitive') 
    done

    # delete temporary uuid variable
    az pipelines variable-group variable delete --group-id ${group_id} --name ${uuid} --yes
fi
```

## Authenticate with Azure DevOps

Most commands used in previous script interact with Azure DevOps and do require authentication. You can authenticate using the `System.AccessToken` security token used by the running pipeline, by assigning it to an environment variable named `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT`, as shown in the following example (see [Azure DevOps CLI in Azure Pipeline YAML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/cli/azure-devops-cli-in-yaml?view=azure-devops#authenticate-with-azure-devops) for additional information).

In addition, you can notice we are also using [predefined variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables) to target the Azure DevOps organization and project (respectively `System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri` and `System.TeamProjectId`).

```yaml
  - task: Bash@3
    displayName: 'Update variable group using terraform outputs'
    inputs:
      targetType: filePath
      arguments: $(System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri) $(System.TeamProjectId) "Platform-VG"
      workingDirectory: $(terraformDirectory)
      filePath: $(scriptsDirectory)/update-variablegroup.sh
    env:
      AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT: $(System.AccessToken)
```

| System variables | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [System.AccessToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#systemaccesstoken)| Special variable that carries the security token used by the running build. |
| [System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#system-variables-devops-services) | The URI of the Azure DevOps organization. |
| [System.TeamProjectId](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#system-variables-devops-services) | The ID of the project that this build belongs to. |

## Library security

Roles are defined for Library items, and membership of these roles governs the operations you can perform on those items.

| Role for library item | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Reader | Can view the item. |
| User | Can use the item when authoring build or release pipelines. For example, you must be a 'User' for a variable group to use it in a release pipeline. |
| Administrator | Can also manage membership of all other roles for the item. The user who created an item gets automatically added to the Administrator role for that item. By default, the following groups get added to the Administrator role of the library: Build Administrators, Release Administrators, and Project Administrators. |
| Creator | Can create new items in the library, but this role doesn't include Reader or User permissions. The Creator role can't manage permissions for other users. |

When using `System.AccessToken`, service account `<ProjectName> Build Service` identity will be used to access the Library.

Please ensure in `Pipelines > Library > Security` section that this service account has `Administrator` role at the `Library` or `Variable Group` level to create/update/delete variables (see. [Library of assets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/?view=azure-devops) for additional information)).
