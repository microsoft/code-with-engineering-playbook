# Azure DevOps: Managing Settings on a Per-Branch Basis

When using [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) for CI/CD, it's convenient to leverage the built-in [pipeline variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables) for [secrets management](../secrets-management/README.md), but using pipeline variables for secrets management has its disadvantages:

- *Pipeline variables are managed outside the code that references them.* This makes it easy to introduce drift between the source code and the secrets, e.g. adding a reference to a new secret in code but forgetting to add it to the pipeline variables (leads to confusing build breaks), or deleting a reference to a secret in code and forgetting to remote it from the pipeline variables (leads to confusing pipeline variables).

- *Pipeline variables are global shared state.* This can lead to confusing situations and hard to debug problems when developers make concurrent changes to the pipeline variables which may override each other. Having a single global set of pipeline variables also makes it impossible for secrets to vary per environment (e.g. when using a branch-based deployment model where 'master' deploys using the production secrets, 'development' deploys using the staging secrets, and so forth).

A solution to these limitations is to manage secrets in the Git repository jointly with the project's source code. As described in [secrets management](../secrets-management/README.md), don't check secrets into the repository in plain text. Instead we can add an encrypted version of our secrets to the repository and enable our CI/CD agents and developers to decrypt the secrets for local usage with some pre-shared key. This gives us the best of both worlds: a secure storage for secrets as well as side-by-side management of secrets and code.

```sh
# first, make sure that we never commit our plain text secrets and generate a strong encryption key
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(LC_ALL=C < /dev/urandom tr -dc '_A-Z-a-z-0-9' | head -c128)"

# now let's add some secret to our .env file
echo "MY_SECRET=..." >> .env

# also update our secrets documentation file
cat >> .env.template <<< "
# enter description of your secret here
MY_SECRET=
"

# next, encrypt the plain text secrets; the resulting .env.enc file can safely be committed to the repository
echo "${ENCRYPTION_KEY}" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pass stdin -in .env -out .env.enc
git add .env.enc .env.template
git commit -m "Update secrets"
```

When running the CI/CD, the build server can now access the secrets by decrypting them. E.g. for Azure DevOps, configure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` as a [secret pipeline variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables#secret-variables) and then add the following step to `azure-pipelines.yml`:

```yaml
steps:
  - script: echo "$(ENCRYPTION_KEY)" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -md sha512 -pass stdin -in .env.enc -out .env -d
    displayName: Decrypt secrets
```

You can also use [variable groups linked directly to Azure key vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#link-secrets-from-an-azure-key-vault) for your pipelines to manage all secrets in one location.
