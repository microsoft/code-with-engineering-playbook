# Deploying with GitOps

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and applications so that the whole system is described declaratively and version controlled (most likely in a Git repository), and having an automated process that ensures that the deployed environment matches the state specified in a repository."- [WeaveWorks](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/#what-is-gitops)

## Why should I use GitOps?

GitOps simply allows faster deployments by having git repositories in the center offering a clear audit trail via git commits and no direct environment access. Read more on [Why should I use GitOps?](https://www.gitops.tech/#why-should-i-use-gitops)

## Tools for GitOps

Some popular GitOps frameworks for Kubernetes backed by [CNCF](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=continuous-integration-delivery) community:

- [Flux V2](https://fluxcd.io/docs/get-started/)
- [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Rancher Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/)

## Deploying using GitOps

GitOps with Flux v2 can be enabled in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) managed clusters or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes connected clusters as a cluster extension. After the microsoft.flux cluster extension is installed, you can create one or more fluxConfigurations resources that sync your Git repository sources to the cluster and reconcile the cluster to the desired state. With GitOps, you can use your Git repository as the source of truth for cluster configuration and application deployment.
