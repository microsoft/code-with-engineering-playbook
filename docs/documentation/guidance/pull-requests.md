# Pull Requests

When we create [Pull Requests](../../code-reviews/pull-requests.md), we must ensure they are properly documented:

- Title and Description
  - [Pull Request Description](../../code-reviews/pull-requests.md#pull-request-description)
  - [Pull Request Template](../../code-reviews/pull-request-template/pull-request-template.md)
- Linked worked items
- Comments
  - As an author, [address all comments](../../code-reviews/process-guidance/author-guidance.md#be-open-to-receive-feedback)
  - As a reviewer, [make comments clear](../../code-reviews/process-guidance/reviewer-guidance.md)
