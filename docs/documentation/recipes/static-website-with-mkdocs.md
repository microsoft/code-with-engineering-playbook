# How to create a static website for your documentation based on mkdocs and mkdocs-material

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a tool built to create static websites from raw markdown files. Other alternatives include [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

We used MkDocs to create [ISE Code-With Engineering Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/) static website from the contents in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook). Then we deployed it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

We found MkDocs to be a good choice since:

1. It's easy to set up and looks great even with the vanilla version.
2. It works well with markdown, which is what we already have in the Playbook.
3. It uses a Python stack which is friendly to many contributors of this Playbook.

For comparison, Sphinx mainly generates docs from restructured-text (rst) format, and Jekyll is written in Ruby.

To setup an MkDocs website, the main assets needed are:

1. An `mkdocs.yaml` file, similar to the one we have [in the Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/mkdocs.yml). This is the configuration file that defines the appearance of the website, the navigation, the plugins used and more.
2. A folder named `docs` (the default value for the directory) that contains the documentation source files.
3. A [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) for automatically generating the website (e.g. on every commit to main), similar to [this one from the Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml).
4. A list of plugins used during the build phase of the website. We specified ours [here](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/requirements-docs.txt). And these are the plugins we've used:

    - [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/): Material design appearance and user experience.
    - [pymdown-extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/): Improves the appearance of markdown based content.
    - [mdx_truly_sane_lists](https://github.com/radude/mdx_truly_sane_lists): For defining the indent level for lists without having to refactor the entire documentation we already had in the Playbook.

Setting up locally is very easy. See [Getting Started with MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) for details.

For publishing the website, there's a [good integration with GitHub for storing the website as a GitHub Page](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/).
