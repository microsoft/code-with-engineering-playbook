# Privacy related frameworks

The following tools/frameworks could be leveraged when data analysis or model development needs to take place on private data.
Note that the use of such frameworks still requires the solution to adhere to privacy regulations and others, and additional safeguards should be applied.

## Typical scenarios for leveraging a Privacy framework

1. Sharing data or results while preserving data subjects' privacy

2. Performing analysis or statistical modeling on private data

3. Developing privacy preserving ML models and data pipelines

## Privacy frameworks

Protecting private data involves the entire data lifecycle, from acquisition, through storage, processing, analysis,
modeling and usage in reports or machine learning models. Proper safeguards and restrictions should be applied in each of these phases.

In this section we provide a **non-exhaustive list** of privacy frameworks which can be leveraged for protecting and preserving privacy.

We focus on four main use cases in the data lifecycle:

1. [Obtaining non-sensitive data](#obtaining-non-sensitive-data)
2. [Establishing trusted research and modeling environments](#trusted-research-and-modeling-environments)
3. [Creating privacy preserving data and ML pipelines](#privacy-preserving-data-pipelines-and-ml)
4. [Data loss prevention](#data-loss-prevention)

### Obtaining non-sensitive data

In many scenarios, analysts, researchers and data scientists require access to a non-sensitive version or sample of the private data.
In this section we focus on two approaches for obtaining non-sensitive data.

**Note:** These two approaches do not guarantee that the outcome would not include private data, and additional measures should be applied.

#### Data de-identification

De-identification is the process of applying a set of transformations to a dataset,
in order to lower the risk of unintended disclosure of personal data.
De-identification involves the removal or substitution of both direct identifiers (such as name, or social security number) or quasi-identifiers,
which can be used for re-identification using additional external information.

De-identification can be applied to different types of data, such as structured data, images and text.
However, de-identification of non-structured data often involves statistical approaches which might result in undetected PII (Personal Identifiable Information) or non-private information being redacted or replaced.

Here we outline several de-identification solutions available as open source:

#### Synthetic data generation

A synthetic dataset is a repository of data generated from actual data and has the same statistical properties as the real data.
The degree to which a synthetic dataset is an accurate proxy for real data is a measure of utility.
The potential benefit of such synthetic datasets is for sensitive applications – medical classifications or financial modelling, where getting hands on a high-quality labelled dataset is often prohibitive.

When determining the best method for creating synthetic data, it is essential first to consider what type of synthetic data you aim to have. There are two broad categories to choose from, each with different benefits and drawbacks:

- Fully synthetic: This data does not contain any original data, which means that re-identification of any single unit is almost impossible, and all variables are still fully available.

- Partially synthetic: Only sensitive data is replaced with synthetic data, which requires a heavy dependency on the imputation model. This leads to decreased model dependence but does mean that some disclosure is possible due to the actual values within the dataset.

### Trusted research and modeling environments

#### Trusted research environments

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) enable organizations to create secure workspaces for analysts,
data scientists and researchers who require access to sensitive data.

TREs enforce a secure boundary around distinct workspaces to enable information governance controls.
Each workspace is accessible by a set of authorized users, prevents the exfiltration of sensitive data,
and has access to one or more datasets provided by the data platform.

We highlight several alternatives for Trusted Research Environments:

| Solution                           | Notes                                                                        |

#### Eyes-off machine learning

In certain situations, Data Scientists may need to train models on data they are not allowed to see. In these cases, an "eyes-off" approach is recommended.
An eyes-off approach provides a data scientist with an environment in which scripts can be run on the data but direct access to samples is not allowed.
When using Azure ML, tools such as the [Identity Based Data Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-identity-based-data-access) can enable this scenario,
alongside proper role assignment for users.

During the processing within the eyes-off environment, only certain outputs (e.g. logs) are allowed to be extracted back to the user.
For example, a user would be able to submit a script which trains a model and inspect the model's performance, but would not be able to see on which samples the model predicted the wrong output.

In addition to the eyes-off environment, this approach usually entails providing access to an "eyes-on" dataset, which is a representative, cleansed, sample set of data for model design purposes.
The Eyes-on dataset is often a de-identified subset of the private dataset, or a synthetic dataset generated based on the characteristics of the private dataset.

#### Private data sharing platforms

Various tools and systems allow different parties to share data with 3rd parties while protecting private entities,
and securely process data while reducing the likelihood of data exfiltration.
These tools include [Secure Multi Party Computation (SMPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) systems,
[Homomorphic Encryption](#homomorphic-encryption) systems, [Confidential Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/),
private data analysis frameworks such as [PySift](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) among others.

### Privacy preserving data pipelines and ML

Even when our data is secure, private entities can still be extracted when the data is consumed.
Privacy preserving data pipelines and ML models focus on minimizing the risk of private data exfiltration during data querying or model predictions.

#### Differential Privacy

Differential privacy (DP) is a system that enables one to extract meaningful insights from datasets about subgroups of people,
while also providing strong guarantees with regards to protecting any given individual's privacy.
This is typically achieved by adding a small statistical noise to every individual's information,
thereby introducing uncertainty in the data.
However, the insights gleaned still accurately represent what we intend to learn about the population in the aggregate.
This approach is known to be robust to re-identification attacks and data reconstruction by adversaries who possess auxiliary information.
For a more comprehensive overview,
check out [Differential privacy: A primer for a non-technical audience](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/38323292/4_Wood_Final.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

DP has been widely adopted in various scenarios such as learning from census data, user telemetry data analysis,
audience engagement to advertisements, and health data insights where PII protection is of paramount importance. However, DP is less suitable for small datasets.

Tools that implement DP include [SmartNoise](https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/smartnoise-samples),
[Tensorflow Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) among some others.

#### Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a form of encryption allowing one to perform calculations on encrypted data without decrypting it first.
The result of the computation *F* is in an encrypted form, which on decrypting gives us the same result if computation *F* was done on raw unencrypted data.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#:~:text=Homomorphic%20encryption%20is%20a%20form,performed%20on%20the%20unencrypted%20data.))

#### Federated learning

Federated learning is a Machine Learning technique which allows the training of ML models in a decentralized way without having to share the actual data.
Instead of sending data to the processing engine of the model,
the approach is to distribute the model to the different data owners and perform training in a distributed fashion.

Federated learning frameworks:

### Data loss prevention

Organizations have sensitive information under their control such as financial data, proprietary data, credit card numbers, health records, or social security numbers.
To help protect this sensitive data and reduce risk, they need a way to prevent their users from inappropriately sharing it with people who shouldn't have it.
This practice is called data loss prevention (DLP). ([Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/dlp-learn-about-dlp))

Below we focus on two aspects of DLP: Sensitive data classification and Access management.

#### Sensitive data classification

Sensitive data classification is an important aspect of DLP, as it allows organizations to track, monitor, secure and identify sensitive and private data.
Furthermore, different sensitivity levels can be applied to different data items, facilitating proper governance and cataloging.

There are typically four levels data classification levels:

1. Public
2. Internal
3. Confidential

#### Access management

Access control is an important component of privacy by design and falls into overall data lifecycle protection.
Successful access control will restrict access only to authorized individuals that should have access to data.
Once data is secure in an environment, it is important to review who should access this data and for what purpose.
Access control may be audited with a comprehensive logging strategy which may include the integration of
[activity logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/platform-logs-overview)
that can provide insight into operations performed on resources in a subscription.
