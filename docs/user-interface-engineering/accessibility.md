# Accessibility

## Trade Studies

All trade studies should consider accessibility requirements for Evaluation Criteria. Accessibility can come in many different forms. For example, there is application based accessibility such as ensuring an application is built with screen-readers in mind. Another example is documentation/training based accessibility for supporting users that speak different languages. Always communicate with stakeholders to best understand the users of the intended tool/application. Accessibility is always easiest to build from the start, adding it on later has proven to be a difficult or even near-impossible task.

Accessibility requirements vary from project to project based on your intended user base. Aside from the default level of accessibility, this section should contain details about any other aspects you must consider during development. Could the application be used by someone who cannot see? What about someone with color blindness? What about someone who cannot use a mouse? If your application has an audio aspect, what about users that cannot hear?

> Did you know that approximately 4.5% of the worlds population is color blind[*](https://www.colorblindguide.com/post/colorblind-people-population-live-counter)? That is over 355 Million people! Accessible design is a requirement for all user interface applications.
