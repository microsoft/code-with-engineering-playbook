# Threat Modelling Example

This document covers the threat models for a sample project which takes video frames from video camera and process these frames on IoTEdge device and send them to Azure Cognitive Service to get the audio output.
 These models can be considered as reference template to show how we can construct threat modeling document. Each of the labeled entities in the figures below are accompanied by meta-information which describe the threats, recommended mitigations, and the associated [security principle or goal](#security-principles).

## Data Flow Diagram

![Diagram Description automatically generated](images/data_flow.png)

- Client Browser makes requests to the M1 IoTEdge module. Browser and IoTEdge device are on same network, so browser directly hits the webapp URL.
- M1 IoTEdge module interacts with other two IoTEdge modules to render live stream from video device and display order scanning results via WebSockets.
- IoTEdge modules interact with Azure Cognitive service to get the translated text via OCR and audio stream via Text to Speech Service.
- IoTEdge modules send telemetry information to application insights.
- IoTEdge device is deployed with IoTEdge runtime which interacts with IoTEdge hub for deployments.
- IoTEdge module also sends some data to Azure storage which is required for debugging purpose.
- Cognitive service, application insights and Azure Storage are authenticated using connection strings which are stored in GitHub secrets and deployed using CI/CD pipelines.

## Assumptions

- Secrets like ACR credentials are stored in GitHub secrets store which are deployed to IoTEdge Device by CI/CD pipelines. However, CI/CD pipelines are out of scope.

Proper authorizations should also be applied to prevent unnecessary privileges.  Whenever available, use Azure Managed Identities to authenticate services. Service Principals may be used if Managed Identities are not supported. External users or services may use UserName + Passwords, Tokens, Certificates or Connection Strings to authenticate, provided these are stored on Key Vault or any other vaulting solution. For authorization, use Azure RBAC to segregate duties and grant only the least amount of access to perform an action at a particular scope. *Applies to Azure services like Azure IoTHub, Azure Cognitive Service, Azure Application Insights are authenticated using connection strings.* |

## Security Principles

- **Confidentiality** refers to the objective of keeping data private or secret. In practice, it’s about controlling access to data to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
- **Integrity** is about ensuring that data has not been tampered with and, therefore, can be trusted. It is correct, authentic, and reliable.
- **Availability** means that networks, systems, and applications are up and running. It ensures that authorized users have timely, reliable access to resources when they are needed.
