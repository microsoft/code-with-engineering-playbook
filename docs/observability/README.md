# Observability

Building observable systems enables development teams at CSE to measure how well the application is behaving. Observability serves the following goals:

- Provide holistic view of the _application health_.
- Help measure _business performance_ for the customer.
- Measure _operational performance_ of the system.
- Identify and _diagnose failures_ to get to the problem fast.
