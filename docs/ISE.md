# Who We Are

Our team, ISE (Industry Solutions Engineering), works side by side with customers to help them tackle their toughest technical problems both in the cloud and on the edge. We meet customers where they are, work in the languages they use, with the open source frameworks they use, on the operating systems they use. We work with enterprises and start-ups across many industries from financial services to manufacturing. Our work covers a broad spectrum of domains including IoT, machine learning, and high scale compute. Our "superpower" is that we work closely with both our customers’ engineering teams and Microsoft’s product engineering teams, developing real-world expertise that we can use to help our customers grow their business and help Microsoft improve our products and services.

We are very community focused in our work, with one foot in Microsoft and one foot in the open source communities that we help. We make pull requests on open source projects to add support for Microsoft platforms and/or improve existing implementations. We build frameworks and other tools to make it easier for developers to use Microsoft platforms. We source all the ideas for this work by maintaining very deep connections with these communities and the customers and partners that use them.

If you like variety, coding in many languages, using any available tech across our industry, digging in with our customers, hack fests, occasional travel, and telling the story of what you’ve done in [blog posts](https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/) and at conferences, then come talk to us.
