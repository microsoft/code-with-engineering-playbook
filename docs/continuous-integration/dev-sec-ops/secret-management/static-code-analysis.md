# Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis is a method of detecting security issues by examining the source code of the application.

## Why Static Code Analysis

Compared to code reviews, Static code analysis tools are more fast, accurate and through.
As it operates on the source code itself, it is a very early indicator for issues, and coding errors found earlier are less costly to fix.

## Applying Static Code Analysis

Static Code Analysis should be integrated in your build process.
There are [many tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools) available for Static Code Analysis, choose the ones that meet your programming language and development techniques.

## Conclusion

Static code analysis is essential to identify potential problems and security issues in the code. It allows you to detect bugs and security issues at an early stage.
