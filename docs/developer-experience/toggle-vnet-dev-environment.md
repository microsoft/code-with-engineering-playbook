# Toggle VNet on and off for production and development environment

## Problem Statement

When deploying resources on Azure in a secure environment, resources are usually created behind a Private Network (VNet), without public access and with private endpoints to consume resources. This is the recommended approach for pre-production or production environments.

Accessing protected resources from a local machine implies one of the following options:

- Use a VPN
- Use a **jump box**
  - With SSH activated (less secure)
  - [With Bastion (recommended approach)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/cloud-scale-analytics/architectures/connect-to-environments-privately#about-azure-bastion-host-and-jumpboxes)

However, a developer may want to deploy a test environment (in a non-production subscription) for their tests during development phase, without the complexity of networking.

In addition, infrastructure code should not be duplicated: it has to be the same whether resources are deployed in a production like environment or in development environment.

## Option

The idea is to offer, **via a single boolean variable**, the option to deploy resources behind a VNet or not using one infrastructure code base. Securing resources behind a VNet usually implies that public accesses are disabled and private endpoints are created. This is something to have in mind because, as a developer, public access must be activated in order to connect to this environment.

The deployment pipeline will set these resources behind a VNet and will secure them by removing public accesses. Developers will be able to run the same deployment script, specifying that resources will not be behind a VNet nor have public accesses disabled.

Let's consider the following use case: we want to deploy a VNet, a subnet, a storage account with no public access and a private endpoint for the table.

The *magic* variable that will help toggling security will be called `behind_vnet`, of type boolean.

Let's implement this use case using `Terraform`.

> The code below does not contain everything, the purpose is to show the pattern and not how to deploy these resources. For more information on Terraform, please refer to the [official documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs).

There is no `if` *per se* in Terraform to define whether a specific resource should be deployed or not based on a variable value. However, we can use the [`count`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) meta-argument. The strength of this meta-argument is if its value is `0`, the block is skipped.

Here is below the code snippets for this deployment:

- variables.tf

    ```terraform
    variable "behind_vnet" {
        type    = bool
    }
    ```

- main.tf

    ```terraform
    resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
        count = var.behind_vnet ? 1 : 0

        name                = "MyVnet"
        address_space       = [x.x.x.x/16]
        resource_group_name = "MyResourceGroup"
        location            = "WestEurope"

        ...

        subnet {
            name              = "subnet_1"
            address_prefix    = "x.x.x.x/24"
        }
    }

    resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_account" {
        name                = "storage"
        resource_group_name = "MyResourceGroup"
        location            = "WestEurope"
        tags                = var.tags

        ...

        public_network_access_enabled = var.behind_vnet ? false : true
    }

    resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "storage_account_table_private_endpoint" {
        count = var.behind_vnet ? 1 : 0

        name                = "pe-storage"
        subnet_id           = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet[0].subnet[0].id

        ...

        private_service_connection {
            name                           = "psc-storage"
            private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_storage_account.storage_account.id
            subresource_names              = [ "table" ]
            ...
        }

        private_dns_zone_group {
            name = "privateDnsZoneGroup"
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

If we run

```bash
terraform apply -var behind_vnet=true
```

then all the resources above will be deployed, and it is what we want on a pre-production or production environment. The instruction `count = var.behind_vnet ? 1 : 0` will set `count` with the value `1`, therefore blocks will be executed.

However, if we run

```bash
terraform apply -var behind_vnet=false
```

the `azurerm_virtual_network` and `azurerm_private_endpoint` resources will be skipped (because `count` will be `0`). The resource `azurerm_storage_account` will be created, with minor differences in some properties: for instance, here, `public_network_access_enabled` will be set to `true` (and this is the goal for a developer to be able to access resources created).

The same pattern can be applied over and over for the entire infrastructure code.

## Conclusion

With this approach, the same infrastructure code base can be used to target a production like environment with secured resources behind a VNet with no public accesses and also a more permissive development environment.

However, there are a couple of trade-offs with this approach:

- if a resource has the `count` argument, it needs to be treated as a list, and not a single item. In the example above, if there is a need to reference the resource `azurerm_virtual_network` later in the code,

    ```terraform
    azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.id
    ```

    will not work. The following must be used

    ```terraform
    azurerm_virtual_network.vnet[0].id # First (and only) item of the collection
    ```

- The meta-argument `count` cannot be used with `for_each` for a whole block. That means that the use of loops to deploy multiple endpoints for instance will not work. Each private endpoints will need to be deployed individually.
