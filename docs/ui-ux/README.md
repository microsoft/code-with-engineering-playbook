# User Interface and User Experience Engineering

Also known as _UI/UX_, _Front End Development_, or _Web Development_, user interface and user experience engineering is a broad topic and encompasses many different aspects of modern application development. When a user interface is required, CSE primarily develops a **web application**. Web apps can be built in a variety of ways with many, many different tools.

## Goal

The goal of the **User Interface Engineering Fundamentals** group is to provide guidance on developing web applications for CSE engagements. Everyone should begin by reading the [General Guidance](#general-guidance) for a quick introduction to the four main aspects of every web application project. From there, readers are encouraged to dive deeper into each topic or being reviewing technical guidance that pertains to their engagement. Keep in mind that like all software, there is no "right way" to build something. Leverage and trust your team's or your customer's experience and expertise for the best development experience.

## General Guidance

The state of web platform engineering is fast moving. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. For any dev crew to be successful in building a UI, they need to have a better understanding of the higher-level aspects of any UI project.

1. **Accessibility** - applications must be accessible for everyone. Exclusive design may work in the immediate time frame but will come back and create major problems in the future. Accessibility is not complicated when included from the beginning.
1. **Usability** - how effortless should it be for any given user to use the application? Do they need special training or a document to understand how to use it, or will it be intuitive?
1. **Maintainability** - is the application just a proof of concept to showcase an idea for future work, or will it be an MVP and act as the starting point for a larger, production-ready application? Sometimes you don't need React or any other framework for that matter. Sometimes you need React but not all the bells and whistles from create-react-app. Understanding project maintainability requirements can simplify an engagementâ€™s tooling needs significantly and let folks iterate without as many headaches.
1. **Stability** - what is the cost of adding a dependency? Is it actively stable/updated/maintained? If not, can you afford the tech debt (sometimes the answer can be yes!)? Could you get 90% of the way there without adding another dependency?
