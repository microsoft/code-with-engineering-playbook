# Cloud Resource Design Guidance

As cloud usage scales, considerations for subscription design, management groups, and resource naming/tagging conventions have an impact on governance, operations management, and adoption patterns.

> **NOTE:** Always work with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that introducing new patterns provides the intended value.
>
> When working in an existing cloud environment, it is important to understand any current patterns and how they are used before making a change to them.
