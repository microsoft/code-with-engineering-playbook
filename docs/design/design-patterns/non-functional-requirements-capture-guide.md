# Non-Functional Requirements Capture

## Goals

In software engineering projects, non-functional requirements, also known as quality attributes, are specifications that define the operational attributes of a system rather than its specific behaviors. Unlike functional requirements, which outline what a system should do, non-functional requirements describe how the system performs certain functions under specific conditions.
Non-functional requirements generally increase the cost as they require special efforts during the implementation, but by defining these requirements in detail early in the engagement, they can be properly evaluated when the cost of their impact on subsequent design decisions is comparatively low.

## Documenting Non-Functional Requirements - Best Practices

- Be specific: Avoid ambiguity and make sure the requirement is quantitative, measurable and testable.
- Relate requirements with business objectives and understand the real impact of the system's behavior.
- Break it down: Try to define requirements at the component or process scope instead of the whole solution.
- Understand trade-off: Non-functional requirements may be in conflict with each other and it can be difficult to balance them and prioritize which one to implement.

## Template

This template can serve as a structured framework for capturing and documenting non-functional requirements effectively. Adjustments can be made to tailor it to the specific needs and preferences of the project team.

- Requirement name: name or title
- Description: brief description. Describe the importance and impact of this requirement to the business.
- Priority: High/Medium/Low or Must-have/Nice-to-have, etc
- Measurement/Metric: metric or measurement criteria
- Verification Method: Automated test, benchmark, simulation, prototyping, etc.
- Constraints: Budget, Time, Resources, Infrastructure, etc.
- Owner/Responsible Party
- Dependencies: technical dependencies, data dependencies, regulatory dependencies, etc.

## Examples

To support the process of capturing a project's _comprehensive_ non-functional requirements, this document offers a taxonomy for non-functional requirements and provides a framework for their identification, exploration, assignment of customer stakeholders, and eventual codification into formal engineering requirements as input to subsequent solution design.
