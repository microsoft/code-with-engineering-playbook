# Sustainable Software Engineering

The choices made throughout the engineering process regarding cloud services, software architecture design and automation can have a big impact on the carbon footprint of a solution.
Some choices are always beneficial, like turning off unused resources.
Other choices require a more nuanced understanding of the business case at hand and its potential carbon impact.

## Goal

One goal of this section is to provide tangible guidance for what sustainable actions you can apply in certain situations and the tools to be able to implement those recommendations.
Another goal is to highlight the many resources available to learn about the wider domain of sustainable software.

## Sustainable Engineering Checklist

This checklist should be used to quickly identify scenarios for which common sustainable actions exist.
Check the box if the scenario applies to your project, then go through the actions and tools you can use to build more sustainable software for those cases.
If there are important nuances to consider, they will be linked in the `Disclaimers` section.

> For readability some considerations are blank, indicating that the action applies to the first consideration above it.
