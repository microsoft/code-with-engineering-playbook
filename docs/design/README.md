# Design

Designing software well is hard.

CSE has collected a number of practices which we find help in the design process.
This covers not only technical design of software, but also architecture design and non-functional requirements gathering for new projects.

## Goals

* Provide recommendations for how to design software for maintainability, ease of extension, and adherence to best practices.
* Reference or define process or checklists to help ensure well-designed software.
* Collate and point to reference sources (guides, repos, articles) that can help shortcut the learning process.
