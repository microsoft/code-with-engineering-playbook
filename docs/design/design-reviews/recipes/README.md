# Design Review Recipes

Design reviews come in all shapes and sizes. There are also different items to consider when creating a design at different stages during an engagement

## Design Review Process

- [Incorporate design reviews throughout the lifetime of an engagement](./engagement-process.md)

## Design Review Templates

### [Game Plan](./high-level-design-recipe.md)

- The same template already in use today
- High level architecture and design
- Includes technologies, languages & products to complete engagement objective

### [Milestone / Epic Design Review](./milestone-epic-design-review-recipe.md)

- Should be considered when an engagement contains multiple milestones or epics
- Design should be more detailed than game plan
- May require unique deployment, security and/or privacy characteristics from other milestones

### [Feature / Story Design Review](./templates/feature-story-design-review.md)

- Design for complex features or stories
- Will reuse deployment, security and other characteristics defined within game plan or milestone
- May require new libraries, OSS or patterns to accomplish goals

### [Task Design Review](./templates/template-task-design-review.md)
