# Template: Technical Spike

## Spike: [Spike Name]

- **Conducted by:** {Names and at least one email address for follow-up questions}
- **Backlog Work Item:** {Link to the work item to provide more context}
- **Sprint**: {Which sprint did the study take place. Include sprint start date}

## Goal

Describe what question(s) the spike intends to answer and why.

## Method

Describe how the team will uncover the answer to the question(s) the spike intends to answer. For example:

1. Build prototype to test.
1. Research existing documents and samples.
1. Discuss with subject matter experts.

## Evidence

Document the evidence collected that informed the conclusions below. Examples may include:

- Recorded or live demos of a prototype providing the desired capabilities
- Metrics collected while testing the prototype
- Documentation that indicates the solution can provided the desired capabilities

## Conclusions

What was the answer to the question(s) outlined at the start of the spike? Capture what was learned that will inform future work.

## Next Steps

What work is expected as an outcome of the learning within this spike. Was there work that was blocked or dependent on the learning within this spike?
