# Memory

These examples were taken from the Memory project, an internal tool for tracking an individual's accomplishments.

The main example here is the [Decision Log](Decision-Log.md).
Since this log was used from the start, the decisions are mostly based on technology choices made in the start of the project.
All line items have a link out to the trade studies done for each technology choice.
