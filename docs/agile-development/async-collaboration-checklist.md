# Asynchronous collaboration & accessibility checklist

Purpose: Practical guidance for distributed teams to collaborate effectively and inclusively across time zones.

## Async standup template

- Summary (yesterday): short bullet(s)
- Plan (today): short bullet(s)
- Blockers / help needed: short bullet(s)

Post the above in a shared channel or issue and use threaded replies for follow-ups.

## Async demo guidance

- Record a short demo (5-8 minutes) focusing on the outcome and acceptance criteria.
- Include a short transcript or key bullet points in the PR or release note.
- Add captions or a brief written summary for accessibility.

## Accessibility checklist for artifacts

- Provide alt text for images and diagrams.
- Ensure headings and lists are semantically correct in markdown.
- Provide captions/transcripts for videos and demos.
- Ensure code samples are in accessible font sizes when shared in docs.

## Meeting scheduling and fairness

- Rotate meeting times or facilitators to share burden across time zones.
- Use asynchronous agendas: post an agenda in advance and capture decisions in writing.

## PR and review expectations

- Include a short PR description and steps to validate.
- Mark urgent reviews clearly; otherwise assume a 24-48 hour review window for non-urgent PRs.
