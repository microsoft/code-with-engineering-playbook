# External Feedback

Various stakeholders can provide feedback to the working product during a project, beyond any formal
review and feedback sessions required by the organization. The frequency and method of collecting
feedback through reviews varies depending on the case, but a couple of good practices are:

- Capture each review in the backlog as a separate user story.
- Standardize the tasks that implement this user story.
- Plan for a review user story per Epic / Feature in your backlog proactively.
