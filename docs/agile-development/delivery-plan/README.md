# Delivery Plan

## Goals

While Scrum does not require, and in fact discourages planning more than one sprint at a time, most of us work in enterprises where we are dependent on each other. For example: marketing, sales, and support needs to have know what is coming up so they can make plans for budget, people and resources. A delivery plan helps to ensure your teams are aligning with your organizational goals.

A rough assessment of the planned project scope should be achievable within a reasonable time frame leveraging the available resources. The goal is to have a rough plan and estimate as a starting point, not to implement "Agilefall."

Note that this is just a starting point to enable planning discussions. We expect the actual schedule to evolve and shift over time, and that you will update the scope and timeline as you progress.

## Benefits

- As you complete the assessment, you can refine the scope, time frame, or ask for additional resources.

- As you progress in your project/product delivery, you can highlight risks to the scope, time frame, and resources.

## Approach

One approach you can take to accomplish is with stickies and a spreadsheet.

Step 1: Stack rank the features for EVERYTHING in the backlog; including

- Functional Features


- User Research and Design (e.g. research, mockups, prototype, usability studies)
- Testing
- Documentation
- Knowledge Transfer/Support Processes

Step 2: T-Shirt features in terms of working weeks per person. In some scenarios, you have no idea how complex the work may be. In this situation, you can ask for time to conduct a spike (timebox the effort spend on spikes).

Step 3: Calculate the capacity for the team based on the number of weeks person with his/her start and end date and minus holidays, vacation, conferences, training, and onboarding days. Also, minus time if the person is also working on defects and support.

Step 4: Based on your capacity, you now have additional options:

- Ask for more resources. Caution: onboarding new resources takes time.

- Reduce the scope to an MVP. Caution: as you trim more of the scope, you risk negatively impacting the project's value propositions. Consider a cupcake which is everything you need. You don't want to skimp on the frosting.

- Ask for more time. Usually, this is the most flexible, but depends on the customer (there could be a fixed marketing date for a new product).

## Tools

You can also leverage one of these tools to visualize a delivery plan by creating your epics and features and add the week's estimates.

The [Plans (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops) feature on Azure DevOps will help you make a plan. Delivery Plans provide a schedule of stories or features your team plan to deliver. Delivery Plans show the scheduled work items by a sprint (iteration path) of selected teams against a calendar view.

Confluence JIRA, Trello, Rally, Asana, Basecamp, and Github Issues are other similar tools in the market (some are free, others you pay a monthly fee, or you can install on-prem) that you can leverage.
