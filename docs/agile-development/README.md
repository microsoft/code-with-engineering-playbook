# Agile Development

In this documentation we refer to the team working on an engagement a **"Crew"**. This includes the dev team, dev lead, PM, data scientists, etc.

## Why Agile

- We want to be quick to respond to change
- We want to get to a state of working software fast, and iterate on it to improve it
- We want to keep the customer/end users involved all the way through
- We care about individuals and interactions over documents and processes

## The Fundamentals

We care about the goal for each activity, but not necessarily about how they are accomplished. The suggestions in parenthesis are common ways to accomplish the goals.

- We keep a shared backlog of work, that everyone in the team can always access (ex. Azure DevOps or GitHub)
- We plan our work in iterations with clear goals (ex. sprints)
- We have a clear idea of when work items are ready to implement (ex. definition of ready)
- We have a clear idea of when work items are completed (ex. definition of done)
- We communicate the progress in one place that everyone can access, and keep the progress up to date (ex. sprint board and daily standups)
- We reflect on our work regularly to make improvements (ex. retrospectives)
- The team has a clear idea of the roles and responsibilities in the project (ex. Dev lead, TPM, Process Lead etc.)
- The team has a joint idea of how we work together (ex. team agreement)
- We value and respect the opinions and work of all team members.
