# Agile/Scrum Roles

- We prefer using "process lead" over "scrum master". It describes the same role.
- Some teams use the term "Process Lead" while others use "Scrum Master". Both typically refer to the role responsible for facilitating team process, removing impediments, and supporting continuous improvement. Choose the name that best fits your team's context and clarify responsibilities on first use.
