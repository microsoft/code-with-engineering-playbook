# Backlog Management basics for the Product and Sprint backlog

## Backlog

- User stories have a clear acceptance criteria and definition of done.
- Design activities are planned as part of the backlog (a design for a story that needs it should be done before it is added in a Sprint).

**Suggestions**

- Consider the backlog refinement as an ongoing activity, that expands outside of the typical "Refinement meeting".
- Technical debt is mostly due to shortcuts made in the implementation as well as the future maintenance cost as the natural result of continuous improvement. Shortcuts should generally be avoided. In some rare instances where they happen, prioritizing and planning improvement activities to reduce this debt at a later time is the recommended approach.
