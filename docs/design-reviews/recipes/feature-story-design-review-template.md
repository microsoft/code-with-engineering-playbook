# Your Feature or Story Design Title Here (prefix with DRAFT/WIP to indicate level of completeness)

> Does the feature re-use or extend existing patterns / interfaces that have already been established for the project?
> Does the feature expose new patterns or interfaces that will establish a new standard for new future development?

* [Feature/Story Name](http://link-to-feature-or-story-work-item)
* Engagement: [Engagement]
* Customer: [Customer]
* Authors: [Author1, Author2, etc.]

## Overview/Problem Statement

* It can also be a link to the [work item](http://link-to-feature-or-story-work-item).
* Describe the feature/story with a high-level summary.
* Consider additional background and justification, for posterity and historical context.
* List any assumptions that were made for this design.

## Goals/In-Scope

* List the goals that the feature/story will help us achieve that are most relevant for the design review discussion.  
* This should include acceptance criteria required to meet [definition of done](../../agile-development/team-agreements/definition-of-done/).

## Non-goals / Out-of-Scope

* List the non-goals for the feature/story.
* This contains work that is beyond the scope of what the feature/component/service is intended for.

## Proposed Design

* Briefly describe the high-level architecture for the feature/story.
* Relevant diagrams (e.g. sequence, component, context, deployment) should be included here.

## Technology

* Describe the relevant OS, Web server, presentation layer, persistence layer, caching, eventing/messaging/jobs, etc. – whatever is applicable to the overall technology solution and how are they going to be used.
* Describe the usage of any libraries of OSS components.
* Briefly list the languages(s) and platform(s) that comprise the stack.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* What are the primary performance and scalability concerns for this feature/story?
* Are there specific latency, availability, and RTO/RPO objectives that must be met?
* Are there specific bottlenecks or potential problem areas? For example, are operations CPU or I/O (network, disk) bound?
* How large are the data sets and how fast do they grow?
* What is the expected usage pattern of the service? For example, will there be peaks and valleys of intense concurrent usage?
* Are there specific cost constraints? (e.g. $ per transaction/device/user)

## Dependencies

* Does this feature/story need to be sequenced after another feature/story assigned to the same team and why?
* Is the feature/story dependent on another team completing other work?
* Will the team need to wait for that work to be completed or could the work proceed in parallel?

## Risks & Mitigation

* Does the team need assistance from subject matter experts?
* What security and privacy concerns does this milestone/epic have?
* Is all sensitive information and secrets treated in a safe and secure manner?

## Open Questions

> List any open questions/concerns here.

## Additional References

> List any additional references here including links to backlog items, work items or other documents.
