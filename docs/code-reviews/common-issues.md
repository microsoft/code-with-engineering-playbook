# Common issues

Here are some of the most common issues that code reviews can help catch:

1. **Bugs and Logical Errors**: Detecting bugs or logical mistakes that might not be evident during initial coding or testing.

2. **Code Standards Violation**: Ensuring the code adheres to established coding standards and conventions for readability and maintainability.

3. **Performance Issues**: Identifying inefficient code that could lead to performance problems, like slow execution or excessive resource usage.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Spotting security flaws, such as SQL injections, buffer overflows, or improper handling of user data.

5. **Code Duplication**: Finding and reducing redundant code, which can make maintenance harder and increase the risk of bugs.

6. **Lack of Scalability**: Recognizing code that may not scale well with increased load or data volume.

7. **Poor Error Handling**: Pointing out insufficient or incorrect error handling that could lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.

8. **Inadequate or Missing Documentation**: Ensuring that code is well-documented for ease of understanding and future maintenance.

9. **Compatibility Issues**: Checking for compatibility with different browsers, operating systems, or hardware, especially in web and mobile app development.

10. **Design Flaws**: Identifying flaws in the software design, like tightly coupled components or violation of [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design), which can affect flexibility and testability.

Addressing these issues during the review process significantly improves the quality and reliability of the software.
