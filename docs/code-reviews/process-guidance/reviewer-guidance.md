# Reviewer Guidance

Since parts of reviews can be automated via linters and such, human reviewers can focus on architectural and functional correctness. Human reviewers should focus on:

- The correctness of the business logic embodied in the code.
- The correctness of any new or changed tests.
- The "readability" and maintainability of the overall design decisions reflected in the code.
- The checklist of common errors that the team maintains for each programming language.

Code reviews should use the below guidance and checklists to ensure positive and effective code reviews.

## General guidance

### Understand the code you are reviewing

- Read every line changed.
- If we have a stakeholder review, it’s not necessary to run the PR unless it aids your understanding of the code.
- AzDO orders the files for you, but you should read the code in some logical sequence to aid understanding.
- If you don’t fully understand a change in a file because you don’t have context, click to view the whole file and read through the surrounding code or checkout the changes and view them in IDE.
- Ask the author to clarify.

### Be considerate

- Be positive – encouraging, appreciation for good practices.
- Avoid language that points fingers like “you” but rather use “we” or “this line” -- code reviews are not personal and language matters.
- Prefer asking questions above making statements. There might be a good reason for the author to do something.
- If you make a direct comment, explain why the code needs to be changed, preferably with an example.
- If a few back-and-forth comments don't resolve a disagreement, have a quick talk with each other (in-person or call). Don't forget to update the PR with what you agreed on and why.

### Make comments clear

- Explain why the code needs to change.
- Prefix a “point of polish” with “Nit:”.
- Suggest changes to a PR by using the suggestion feature (available in [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request) and Azure DevOps) or by creating a PR to the author branch.
- If one or two comments don’t resolve a disagreement, talk in person or create group discussion.

### Code reviews shouldn't include many lines of code

It's easy to say a developer can review 400 or more lines but when code surpasses certain amount of lines of code effectiveness of defects discovery can decrease and there is a chance of not having a good review or just letting bugs pass to main branch or another stage. Setting a line of code limit is as important as a time limit.

### Decide on a common standard for each language

- Automate as much as possible (styling, etc.) to avoid the need for "Nit's" and allow the reviewer to focus more on functional aspects of the PR.

## First Design Pass

### Pull Request Overview

- Does the PR description make sense?
- Do all the changes logically fit in this PR, or are there unrelated changes?
- If necessary, are the changes made reflected in updates to the README or other docs? Especially if the changes affect how the user builds code.

### User Facing Changes

- If the code involves a user-facing change, is there a GIF/photo that explains the functionality? If not, it might be key to validate the PR to ensure the change does what is expected.
- Ensure UI changes look good without unexpected behavior.

### Design

- Do the interactions of the various pieces of code in the PR make sense?
- Does the code recognize and incorporate architectures and coding patterns?

## Code Quality Pass

### Complexity

- Are functions too complex?
- Is the single responsibility principle followed? Function or class should do one ‘thing’.
- Should a function be broken into multiple functions?
- If a method has greater than 3 arguments, it is potentially overly complex.
- Does the code add functionality that isn’t needed?
- Can the code be understood easily by code readers?

### Naming/readability

- Did the developer pick good names for functions, variables, etc?

### Error Handling

- Are errors handled gracefully and explicitly where necessary?

### Functionality

- Is there parallel programming in this PR that could cause race conditions? Carefully read through this logic.
- Could the code be optimized? For example: are there more calls to the database than need be?
- How does the functionality fit in the bigger picture? Can it have negative effects to the overall system?
- Are there security flaws?
- Does a variable name reveal any customer specific information?
- Is PII and EUII treated correctly? Are we logging any PII information?

### Style

- Are there extraneous comments? If the code isn’t clear enough to explain itself, then the code should be made simpler. Comments may be there to explain why some code exists.
- Does the code adhere to the style guide/conventions that we have agreed upon? We use automated styling like black and prettier.

### Tests

- Tests should always be committed in the same PR as the code itself (‘I’ll add tests next’ is not acceptable).
- Make sure tests are sensible and valid assumptions are made.
- Make sure edge cases are handled as well.
- Tests can be a great source to understand the changes. It can be a strategy to look at tests first to help you understand the changes better.
