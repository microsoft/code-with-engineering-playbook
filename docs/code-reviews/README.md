# Code Reviews

Code reviews are an essential part of the software development process, offering numerous benefits such as improved code quality, shared knowledge, and early bug detection. However, the effectiveness of these reviews largely depends on the approach and mindset of the participants.

## Goals

Code review is a way to have a conversation about the code where participants will:

- **Improve code quality** by identifying and removing defects before they can be introduced into shared code branches.
- **Learn and grow** by having others review the code, we get exposed to unfamiliar design patterns or languages among other topics, and even break some bad habits.
- **Shared understanding** between the developers over the project's code.

## When do I conduct a code review?

Developers working on projects should conduct peer code reviews on every pull request (or check-in to a shared branch).
