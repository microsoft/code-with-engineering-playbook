SUBJECT:  Code Review [PR#/Description]


Hello [TEAM],
 
I would like to conduct a code review on [PR #/Description/link].
 
Your homework before the review is to spend a short amount of time reviewing the PR.
 
Our Agenda for the review is as follows:

Overview of the change
Walkthrough of code changes
Review and Discussion
Action Item generation
Wrap-up and Follow-up
 
Iâ€™m looking forward to great collaboration and feedback!
 
Thank you
