# Technical Debt

Even when following the engineering fundamentals in this playbook, you are likely to accrue some technical debt as your code base evolves and matures over time. Technical debt can include any changes you would make to your code if you had the opportunity to do so. Examples include refactoring a large function into multiple, smaller functions using the single-responsibilty principle or implementing more consistent naming conventions in your code to improve readability. Addressing technical debt early in a project can minimize rework and help improve code quality for additional features developed in future sprints. However, it's never too late to address technical debt. Even large code bases running in production can be improved to be more performant, secure, and maintainable if you identify, priortizem and resolve technical debt in your code.
