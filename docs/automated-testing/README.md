## Build for Testing

Testing is a critical part of the development process.  It is important to build your application with testing in mind.  Here are some tips to help you build for testing:

- **Parameterize everything.** Rather than hard-code any variables, consider making everything a configurable parameter with a reasonable default. This will allow you to easily change the behavior of your application during testing. Particularly during performance testing, it is common to test different values to see what impact that has on performance. If a range of defaults need to change together, consider one or more parameters which set "modes", changing the defaults of a group of parameters together.

- **Document at startup.** When your application starts up, it should log all parameters. This ensures the person reviewing the logs and application behavior know exactly how the application is configured.

- **Log to console.** Logging to external systems like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services. This requires logs to be dispatched from the local system to the external system and that is a dependency that can fail. It is important that someone be able to console logs directly on the local system.

- **Log to external system.** In addition to console logs, logging to an external system like Azure Monitor is desirable for traceability across services and durability of logs.

- **Log all activity.** If the system is performing some activity (reading data from a database, calling an external service, etc.), it should log that activity. Ideally, there should be a log message saying the activity is starting and another log message saying the activity is complete. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand what the application is doing and how long it is taking. Depending on how noisy this is, different messages can be associated with different log levels, but it is important to have the information available when it comes to debugging a deployed system.

- **Correlate distributed activities.** If the system is performing some activity that is distributed across multiple systems, it is important to correlate the activity across those systems. This can be done using a Correlation ID that is passed from system to system. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand the entire flow of activity. For more information, please see [Observability in Microservices](../observability/microservices.md).

- **Log metadata.** When logging, it is important to include metadata that is relevant to the activity. For example, a Tenant ID, Customer ID, or Order ID. This allows someone reviewing the logs to understand the context of the activity and filter to a manageable set of logs.

- **Log performance metrics.** Even if you are using App Insights to capture how long dependency calls are taking, it is often useful to know long certain functions of your application took. It then becomes possible to evaluate the performance characteristics of your application as it is deployed on different compute platforms with different limitations on CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. For more information, please see [Metrics](../observability/pillars/metrics.md).
