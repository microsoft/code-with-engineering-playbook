# Gauge Framework

Gauge is a free and open source framework for writing and running E2E tests. Some key features of Gauge that makes it unique include:

- Simple, flexible and rich syntax based on Markdown.
- Consistent cross-platform/language support for writing test code.
- A modular architecture with plugins support
- Extensible through plugins and hackable.
- Supports data driven execution and external data sources
- Helps you create maintainable test suites
- Supports Visual Studio Code, Intellij IDEA, IDE Support

## What is a Specification

Gauge specifications are written using a Markdown syntax. For example

```bash
# Search for the data blob

## Look for file
* Goto Azure blob
```

In this specification *Search for the data blob* is the **specification heading**, *Look for file* is a **scenario** with a step *Goto Azure blob*

## What is an Implementation

You can implement the steps in a specification using a programming language, for example:

```bash
from getgauge.python import step
import os
from step_impl.utils.driver import Driver
@step("Goto Azure blob")
def gotoAzureStorage():
  URL = os.getenv('STORAGE_ENDPOINT')
  Driver.driver.get(URL)
```

The Gauge runner reads and runs steps and its implementation for every scenario in the specification and generates a report of passing or failing scenarios.

```bash
# Search for the data blob

## Look for file  ✔

Successfully generated html-report to => reports/html-report/index.html
Specifications:       1 executed      1 passed        0 failed        0 skipped
Scenarios:    1 executed      1 passed        0 failed        0 skipped
```

## Re-using Steps

Gauge helps you focus on testing the flow of an application. Gauge does this by making steps as re-usable as possible. With Gauge, you don’t need to build custom frameworks using a programming language.

For example, Gauge steps can pass parameters to an implementation by using a text with quotes.

```bash
# Search for the data blob

## Look for file
* Goto Azure blob
* Search for "store_data.csv"
```

The implementation can now use “store_data.csv” as follows

```bash
from getgauge.python import step
import os
@step("Search for <query>")
def searchForQuery(query):
  write(query)
  press("Enter")

step("Search for <query>", (query) => {
  write(query);
  press("Enter");
```

You can then re-use this step within or across scenarios with different parameters:

```bash
# Search for the data blob

## Look for Store data #1
* Goto Azure blob
* Search for "store_1.csv"

## Look for Store data #2
* Goto Azure blob
* Search for "store_2.csv"
```

Or combine more than one step into **concepts**

```bash
# Search Azure Storage for <query>
* Goto Azure blob
* Search for "store_1.csv"
```

The concept, Search Azure Storage for `<query>` can be used like a step in a specification

```bash
# Search for the data blob

## Look for Store data #1
* Search Azure Storage for "store_1.csv"

## Look for Store data #2
* Search Azure Storage for "store_2.csv"
```

## Data-Driven Testing

Gauge also supports data driven testing using Markdown tables as well as external csv files for example

```bash
# Search for the data blob

| query   |
|---------|
| store_1 |
| store_2 |
| store_3 |

## Look for stores data
* Search Azure Storage for <query>
```

This will execute the scenario for all rows in the table.

In the examples above, we refactored a specification to be concise and flexible without changing the implementation.
