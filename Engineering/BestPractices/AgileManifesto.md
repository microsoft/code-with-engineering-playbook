# Learn about Agile Manifesto and try to follow its values and principles

## (https://agilemanifesto.org)

### We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan

### Principles behind the Agile Manifesto:

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

* Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
