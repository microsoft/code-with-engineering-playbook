# Establishing and managing documentation

Documentation should be source controlled. [Pull Requests](../guidance/pull-requests.md) could then be used to tell others about the changes, so they can be reviewed and discussed. E.g., [Async Design Reviews](../../design-reviews/recipes/async-design-reviews.md).

Tools:

- [Wikis](../tools/wikis.md).
