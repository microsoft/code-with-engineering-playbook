# Definition of Ready

When the development team picks a user story from the top of the backlog, the user story needs to have enough detail to estimate the work needed to complete the story within the sprint. If it has enough detail to estimate, it is Ready to be developed.

  `In case a user story is not Ready in the beginning of the Sprint it increases the chance that your story will not be done at the end of this print.`

## What it is

Definition of Ready is the agreement made by the scrum team around how complete a user story should be to be selected as candidate for estimation in the sprint planning.

It can be understood as a checklist that helps the Product Owner to ensure that the user story he wrote contains all the necessary and the enough content to the scrum team.

### Examples of ready checklist items:

* [ ] Does the description have the details and input values required to implement the user story?
* [ ] Does the user story have clear and complete acceptance criteria?
* [ ] Does the user story address the business need?
* [ ] Can we measure the acceptance criteria?

## Who writes it

The ready checklist can be written by a Product Owner in agreement with the development team and the scrum master.

## When should a Definition of Ready be updated

Update or change the definition of ready anytime the scrum team observes that there are missing information in the user stories that recurrently impacts the planning.

## What should be avoided

The ready checklist should contain items that apply broadly. Don't include items or details that only apply to one or two user stories. This may become an overhead when writing the user stories.
