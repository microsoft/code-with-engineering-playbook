# Follow Minimalism Rules

## (<http://minifesto.org/>)

* Fight for Pareto's law, look for the 20% of effort that will give you the 80% of results
* Prioritize, minimalism isn't about not doing things but about focusing first in the important
* Perfect is enemy of good, first do it, then do it right, then do it better
* Kill the baby, don't be afraid of starting all over again. Fail soon, learn fast
* Add value. Think constantly about how you can help your team and position yourself in that field/skill
* Basics, first. Follow always a top-down thinking starting by the best-practices of CS
* Think different. Simple is harder than complex, which means you'll need to use your creativity
* Synthesis is the key of communication. We have to write code for humans not machines
* Keep it plain. Try to keep your designs with few layers of indirection. Clean kipple and redundancy. Minimalism is all about removing distractions
