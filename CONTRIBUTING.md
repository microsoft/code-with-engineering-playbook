# Contributing

Demonstrating Engineering Fundamentals is core to what we do in ISE and is one of the primary values we bring to our customers, helping them to level up while collaborating on their business scenarios.

The purpose of this repo is to provide guidance to ISE software engineers and data scientists (together forming a Dev Crew) with regards to engineering fundamentals. It describes recommended practices based on continuous project learnings in different areas. It can be used as a tool at the beginning of an engagement that can be shared with customers to help set the project up for success. This repo is *not* intended as a code repo, instead it provides guidance and links to appropriate sample code repos that represent good examples.

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

## What to contribute

- Patterns and practices that have worked well in engagements, related to our engineering fundamentals
- Content that can be publicly visible (avoid confidential information)
- Content that is generally applicable (avoid references to internal processes, or very specific information)
- Short code snippets or links to OSS repos (avoid large code assets)

If you are unsure if your content will match this playbook, you are welcome to contact one of the [Engineering Fundamentals Champs](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) to discuss the contribution.

## General guidance

- Quality is more important than quantity
- Write in a way that you would want someone else to explain something to you. Use [`plain english`](http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html)
- Be friendly, technical, professional and concise
- Communicate as engineers, not marketing; we want to share what we learned, not "sell" our ideas
- Don't recreate introductory content, link to it
- Add context around patterns, recipes etc. so that the reader understands when and where a pattern may be applicable and where it may not
- Think about how readers can discover your content, is it easy to find?

> NOTE: Please discuss with one of the [maintainers](#maintainers) before adding a new top level section. Try to find a suitable home in an existing section if possible.

We welcome maintenance of the repository and contributions that:

- Makes the content more readable
- Makes the content more discoverable
- Fixes content that has gone out-of-date

or anything that improves the quality of the playbook

## How to contribute

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have
the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label,
comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

### Permissions & Contributions

There are two ways in which you can help update the content:

- **One-off:** \
If you are not a regular contributor to the project, but you would like to contribute some changes, the best way to do it is by [submitting a PR](#submitting-a-pr)

- **Periodic and regular contributions:** \
If you plan to update the content semi-regularly or regularly, you can be added to the project's Contributors group. Please contact one of the [maintainers](#maintainers) to be added to the group. You will still need to submit a PR against main in order to merge your changes.

> NOTE: You need to be part of the `Microsoft organization` in GitHub to be added to the contributors group. You need to be also part of the `Microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook-collaborators teams` in github.

Since this is not considered an internal Microsoft github repo, you cannot use the microsoft github alias for committing changes. You have to use your personal github account which is linked to Microsoft account. If you use the microsoft github account, you will see this error while trying to create a PR - **"You cannot contribute to repositories outside of your enterprise `Microsoft EMU`"**.

### Submitting a PR

- Add your changes to a new branch `<github alias>/<title>` or by forking the repository
- Open a PR with a clear description of the changes
- Tag the PR with the appropriate area, and link any issues that the PR closes
- Add reviewers (you will need 2 reviewers to merge) to the PR, for example the [maintainers](#maintainers) or anyone from the [EF champs team](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)

### Link checks

Before a pull request can be merged, any links in the documents will be checked to make sure that they are still live.

On occasion, you will find that the link checker will fail on links that you can reach fine with a browser. It may also fail on links that are not in the documents that you submitted changes to.

When this occurs, do the following

1. Verify that the link is OK, if it redirects, change the path to be the final link.
1. If the link is not ok, fix the link (even if it is not in your document) if you find a good equivalent link. If you can't find a good equivalent link, contact one of the [maintainers](#maintainers) for a solution.
1. Re-run the job, or ask to have the job re-run (if you are a first time contributor). Sometimes the link checker fails due to temporary connectivity issues.
1. If the link checker still fails, and you have confirmed that the link is ok, exclude the link from checking, in the `.markdownlinkcheck.json` file in the root of the repository.

## Running Locally (*Remotely*)

To run the site locally, you must have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and the [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) installed on your machine.

After cloning this repo, open it in VSCode. Open the VSCode command prompt using `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + P` and run the `Remote-Container: Rebuild and Reopen in Container` command (make sure Docker is also running on your machine).

After sometime, VSCode should reopen this repository in the remote dev container and install the required dependencies.

Finally, launch the site locally using the `mkdocs serve` command from the root of the repo.
